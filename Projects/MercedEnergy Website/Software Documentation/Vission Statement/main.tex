\section*{Vission Statement}
\Large For those interested in becoming part of a team, future clients, and the community, and those who want to learn about Merced Energy. The Merced Energy website will serve as a point of contact, and create awareness of what members of Merced Energy have accomplished. A website that will help create a personal brand for contributing members by displaying the skills acquired from completed projects. Unlike well-established technology companies, Merced Energy will be developed from scratch by university students using Open Source tools and community support. Our product will revolve around giving members a platform to showcase their skills and how they improved battery technology.
